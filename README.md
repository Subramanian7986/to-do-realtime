# To-Do List App

A modern, sleek, and intuitive To-Do List application built with React. This app allows you to easily manage tasks, set reminders, and categorize tasks for better organization. It stores tasks locally using `localStorage`, ensuring that tasks persist even when the page is refreshed.

- **Categorize Tasks**: Organize tasks into categories like 'To-Do', 'In Progress', and 'Completed'.
- **Set Reminders**: Get notifications before your tasks are due.
- **Filter Tasks**: Filter tasks by category.
- **Persist Tasks**: Tasks are saved in `localStorage` to ensure they persist between sessions.
